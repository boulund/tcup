    :alt: |name| overview; input blast8, output estimated taxonomic composition
        and detected antibiotic resistance proteins.
    :align: center

|name| uses peptides generated by mass spectrometry proteomics to:

* identify and estimate the taxonomic composition of a microbial sample.
* detect expressed antibiotic resistance proteins.
 
|name| does not require a priori information about the contents of a sample and
is suitable for analysis of both pure cultures, mixed samples, and clinical
samples.

Read :doc:`introduction` for more details on how it works. If you prefer to
throw yourself head-first into |name| without first knowing the details of how
it works, check out :doc:`installation` right away to get started!
